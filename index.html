      <h2>Favorite Cmsc subject so far and why</h2>
      <p>
        CMSC 22. I really liked the pacing of the subject and also I liked the
        programming language that was used.

      <h2>Favorite GE so far and why</h2>
      <p>
        Ethics 1 because during the synchronus discussions my instructor used
        relatable references, images, and memes.

      <h2>Favorite programming language so far and why</h2>
      <p>
        JAVA because it was fun for me to do abstraction and remove redundant
        code. coding in java is also quite easy due to it having multiple ways
        to do things like different kinds of loops and many more.
